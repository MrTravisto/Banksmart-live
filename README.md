# BankSmart — Static Demo Site
This package is a ready-to-upload static site for GitHub Pages / Netlify.

**What's included**
- `index.html` — main site (single-file demo)
- Affiliate links automatically append `?ref=banksmart`
- Footer credit: Built & Maintained by Trevor

**How to deploy**
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `Banksmart-live`).
2. Upload these files to the repository root (or drag & drop the ZIP contents).
3. Enable GitHub Pages from repository settings (branch `main` / `gh-pages`, root).
4. (Optional) Add a `CNAME` file with your domain (e.g. `banksmart.co.za`) in repo root.
5. Or drag the extracted files to Netlify / Vercel for instant deploy.

**Notes**
- This demo uses static example fees. To use live fees you will need a backend or a scheduled script to scrape/consume bank APIs.
- Affiliate prefix used: `ref=banksmart` (opens in a new tab for best conversion).
